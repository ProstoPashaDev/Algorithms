### 🧮 Differential equations solve Methods
- **Euler method** – One-step iterative method that approximates the solution of ODEs using the slope at the beginning of each interval; simple but less accurate.
- **Runge–Kutta method (RK4)** – One-step iterative method that computes slopes at multiple points within each step to achieve higher accuracy; widely used for general-purpose ODE solving.
- **Adams method** – Multistep method that uses previous points’ slopes (explicit Adams–Bashforth or implicit Adams–Moulton) to predict the next value; efficient and accurate for longer intervals, often initialized with a one-step method.
